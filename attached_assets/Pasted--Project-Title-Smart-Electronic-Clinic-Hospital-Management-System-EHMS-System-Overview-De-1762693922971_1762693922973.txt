✅ Project Title

Smart Electronic Clinic / Hospital Management System (EHMS)

✅ System Overview / Description

The Electronic Clinic/Hospital Management System is a web-based application that manages hospital operations digitally. It handles:

Patient registration

Appointment booking

Electronic health records (EHR)

Doctor–patient consultation workflow

Pharmacy medicine dispensing

Billing and payment

(Optional) Blockchain-backed clinical data sharing & audit tracking

Your stack:

Frontend: Next.js (React UI pages)

Backend: Next.js API routes (/api/*)

Database: MongoDB + Mongoose

✅ Users / Actors
Role	Permissions
Admin	Full system access, manage staff, configure system
Doctor	Access patient records assigned/permission-based, consultations, prescriptions
Patient	Medical profile, book appointments, view prescriptions, pay bills
Pharmacist	Manage inventory, dispense medication, view prescriptions
Nurse / Receptionist (optional)	Register patients, schedule appointments
Laboratory Staff (optional)	Manage lab test requests and results
✅ Core Features (Requirements)
🔹 1. Authentication & Role Management

JWT-based session authentication (NextAuth optional)

Login with email + password

Role-based access control (Admin / Doctor / Patient / Pharmacy)

🔹 2. Patient Management

Functions

Patient registration (by patient or staff)

Patient profile: bio-data, medical history, allergies, etc.

Upload & store patient documents (scan results, reports)

Database example (MongoDB - Patient model)

Patient: {
  firstName, lastName, dob, gender, contactInfo,
  medicalHistory, allergies, insuranceDetails,
  emergencyContact, createdBy, createdAt
}

🔹 3. Appointment Scheduling (Booking System)

Features

Patient selects doctor, date, and time

Doctor dashboard shows upcoming appointments

Email / SMS / WhatsApp notification (optional)

Appointment status (pending / approved / completed / canceled)

🔹 4. Electronic Health Record (EHR)

Doctor can view past visits, lab results, prescriptions

Add clinical notes, symptoms, diagnosis

EHR Record Structure

Record: {
  patientId, doctorId,
  symptoms, diagnosis, treatments,
  attachments, consultationFee,
  status: "open" | "closed"
}

🔹 5. Consultation + Smart Contract-inspired Workflow

(from your 3rd diagram)

Patient Action	System Action
Book appointment	Notify doctor
Doctor consultation done	System stores consultation record
Doctor issues prescription	Pharmacy notified
Patient approves payment	Billing processed
🔹 6. Prescription & Pharmacy Module

Doctor issues prescription digitally

Pharmacist views pending prescriptions

Medicines dispensed → system updates inventory

Mark prescription as dispensed

Inventory tracking

Add/Edit/Delete drugs

Quantity tracking

Automated low-stock alert

🔹 7. Laboratory Test Module (optional)

Doctor requests lab test

Lab uploads test result (PDF or data)

Result visible in patient EHR automatically

🔹 8. Billing & Payment

Automatic invoice generation when appointment/consultation is completed

Status tracking (paid/unpaid)

Payment options: cash, transfer, card, insurance

🔹 9. Blockchain-inspired Clinical Data Sharing (optional)

(From images you uploaded)

If you implement this:

Store patient data in encrypted form

Use logs / audit trails for every data access

Store hash of records to blockchain (not full data)

Actions:

Action	Blockchain
New appointment / EHR update	Append record
Prescription issued	Append record
Payment completed	Append record
🔹 10. Backup & Data Security

Automated daily backup of MongoDB

Encrypted at-rest and in-transit

GDPR/HIPAA compliance concepts (data privacy)
